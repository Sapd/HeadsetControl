      Thank you for your input!  
      
      **Note**: Probably only people with the same device can help to implement the protocol for it
      That is why it is a good idea to try it yourself ðŸš€! Take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl/wiki/Development).
      
      We are here to help you. You can provide WireShark logs, ask for help in Coding and open up a PR any time.
