            Hello 👋

            Thank you for reaching out and expressing interest in having support for a new headset.
            We appreciate your willingness to contribute to the project!

            In order to create a implementation for a specific headset, we need to be able to reverse-engineer and test the implementation on that particular device.
            Explicitly speaking, only people who actually own the headset, can implement that request.

            👉 If you're interested in adding support for a specific headset, we recommend taking a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl/wiki/Development) to get started.

            📝 If you encounter any problems while using WireShark, we would be more than happy to help. Simply post screenshots and data on your progress.
